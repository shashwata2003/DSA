/* 
Count of ordered pairs (i, j) such that arr[i] and arr[j] concatenates to X:
Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer X, the task is to find the number of ordered pairs (i, j) 
such that i != j and X is the concatenation of the numbers arr[i] and arr[j] 
eg:
Input: N = 4, arr[] = {1, 212, 12, 12}, X = 1212
Output: 3
Explanation: X = 1212 can be obtained by concatenating:

numbers[0] = 1 with numbers[1] = 212
numbers[2] = 12 with numbers[3] = 12
numbers[3] = 12 with numbers[2] = 12
Therefore, number of possible ordered pairs are 3

Input: N = 3, arr[] = {11, 11, 110}, X = 11011
Output: 2
