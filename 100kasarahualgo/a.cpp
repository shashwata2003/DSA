Count Strongly Connected Components (Kosarajuâ€™s Algorithm):
You are given an unweighted directed graph having 'V' vertices and 'E' edges. Your task is to count the number of strongly connected components (SCCs) present in the graph.

A directed graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
 The strongly connected components of a graph are the subgraphs which are themselves strongly connected
