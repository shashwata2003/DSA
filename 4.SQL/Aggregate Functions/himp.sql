Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

/*
Approach
We want to calculate the fraction of players who logged in again on the day after their first login. To do this, we need to count two things: the number of players who logged in on consecutive days and the total number of players.

To count the number of players who logged in on consecutive days, we need to find the first login date for each player and check if there is a login on the day after their first login.

We use a subquery to calculate the total number of distinct players in the Activity table. This gives us the denominator for calculating the fraction.

In the main query, we filter the rows where the player's ID and the date of the event (after subtracting 1 day) match the player's first login date. This ensures that we only consider players who logged in on consecutive days.

We then count the distinct player IDs in the filtered rows to get the numerator for calculating the fraction.

Finally, we divide the numerator by the denominator and round the result to 2 decimal places using the ROUND function.
