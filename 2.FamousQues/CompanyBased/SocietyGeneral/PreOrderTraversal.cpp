/* 
Amir needs a program to construct a binary tree from user-provided input and analyze it. 
The program takes the number of nodes and their values as input, constructs the binary tree, performs 
a pre-order traversal, and computes the sum of all node values encountered during traversal.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of nodes in the binary tree.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the values of the nodes in the binary tree.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Preorder Traversal: " followed by the pre-order traversal of the constructed 
binary tree.

The second line prints "Sum: " followed by the sum of all node values in the binary tree.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 15

1 ≤ node values ≤ 150

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4
15 62 34 27
Output 1 :
Preorder Traversal: 15 62 27 34 
Sum: 138
Input 2 :
6
9 5 3 7 1 2
Output 2 :
Preorder Traversal: 9 5 7 1 3 2 
Sum: 27
