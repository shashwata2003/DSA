Q12:
Problem Statement:



Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.



Example 1:



Input: n=9

nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]

Output: 6

Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.



Example 2:



Input: n=1 

nums = [1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum of 1.



Example 3:



Input: n=5 

nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]

Output: 23

Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum of 23.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, representing the number of elements in the array nums.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array nums.

Output format :
The output prints an integer, representing the sum of the subarray with the largest sum.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
