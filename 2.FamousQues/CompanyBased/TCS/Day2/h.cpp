Q6:
In the K-partition problem, we need to partition an array of positive integers into k-disjoint subsets that all have an equal sum and completely cover the set.
Example
Input:
9
7 5 2 6 6 1 8 9 4 
4

Output:
Partition 0 is 8 4 
Partition 1 is 2 1 9 
Partition 2 is 6 6 
Partition 3 is 7 5 

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an array size, N.

The second line consists of an array of elements separated by space.

The third line represents the value of k.

Output format :
The output prints the possible partitions that have an equal sum.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
9
7 5 2 6 6 1 8 9 4 
4
Output 1 :
Partition 0 is 8 4 
Partition 1 is 2 1 9 
Partition 2 is 6 6 
Partition 3 is 7 5 
Input 2 :
5
5 6 3 1 4 
3
Output 2 :
k-partition of set S is not possible
