Backtracking is method in which we check all the possible ways and we discard or remember the results given by
a previous iteration.

Rat in a Maza:
You are given a starting position for a rat which is stuck in a maze at an initial point (0, 0)
(the maze can be thought of as a 2-dimensional plane). The maze would be given in the form of a square 
matrix of order 'N' * 'N' where the cells with value 0 represent the mazeâ€™s blocked locations while value
1 is the open/available path that the rat can take to reach its destination. The rat's destination is at 
('N' - 1, 'N' - 1). 

we need to find the ans in sorted order that mean we will check the possible paths in the order (D,L,R,U);

Sample Input 1:
4
1 0 0 0 
1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1
Sample Output 1:
DDRDRR DRDDRR
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths, i.e. DRDDRR and DDRDRR
when printed in sorted order, we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.

Apporach: Backtracking:
we are going to use a n*n matrix called the visited which will keep track of the nodes with will done visiting

init = mark 0,0 as visited and ans = " "

** a box is considered safe when:
1. visited to that box != 1
2. when the box is in N*N
3. and when matrix val of that box == 1

1. first check weather it is safe to make D motion from the current position and if not then check for 
L, R and U
2. do this till be reach the N * N the destination else return null


If needed see the video once again.
